# ðŸ“¦ Complete Application Code - Copy & Paste Ready

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Restoration

I cannot create all files at once due to size limits, but here's what you need to do:

### **Option 1: Use Git to Restore** (RECOMMENDED)

If you have git history:

```cmd
cd "d:\Decentralized disaster resource sharing app"
git log --oneline
```

Find the commit BEFORE you deleted the map, then:

```cmd
git checkout <commit-hash> -- disaster-resource-frontend/src/components/
git checkout <commit-hash> -- disaster-resource-frontend/src/App.js
```

### **Option 2: I'll Create Key Files**

I'll create the essential files one by one. Let me know which specific component you need first:

1. **LoginForm.jsx** âœ… (Already created)
2. **RegisterForm.jsx** - User registration
3. **DonorDashboard.jsx** - Add resources
4. **RequesterDashboard.jsx** - Submit requests
5. **VolunteerDashboard.jsx** - Accept deliveries
6. **RatingModal.jsx** - Rate volunteers
7. **Header.jsx** - Navigation
8. **App.js** - Main app with routing

### **Option 3: Download from Documentation**

Your documentation shows the app was "PRODUCTION READY". Do you have:
- A backup folder?
- A zip file?
- Another computer with the code?
- GitHub repository?

## ðŸš€ What I Can Do Right Now

Tell me which approach you prefer:

1. **"Create all components"** - I'll create them one by one (will take multiple messages)
2. **"Help me use git"** - I'll help you restore from git history
3. **"Just make it work"** - I'll create a minimal working version quickly
