# üß† Smart Resource Matching System - Complete Guide

## üéØ Overview

The **Smart Matching Algorithm** is an intelligent, multi-criteria system that automatically matches resource requests with the best available resources and volunteers. It uses a **scoring system (0-100 points)** to evaluate and rank matches based on multiple factors.

---

## üîç How Smart Matching Works

### **Two-Stage Matching Process**

1. **Stage 1: Resource Matching**
   - Finds the best resource for the request
   - Scores based on: proximity, quantity, donor rating, freshness, urgency

2. **Stage 2: Volunteer Matching**
   - Finds the best volunteer for the delivery
   - Scores based on: proximity to donor, proximity to requester, rating, workload

## üìä Resource Matching Algorithm

### **Scoring Criteria (Total: 100 points)**

#### 1. **Proximity Score** (40 points)
Measures distance between resource location and requester location.

| Distance | Score | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| 0-5 km | 40 points | 100% |
| 5-10 km | 30 points | 75% |
| 10-20 km | 20 points | 50% |
| 20-50 km | 10 points | 25% |
| >50 km | 5 points | 12.5% |

**Why it matters:** Closer resources mean faster delivery and lower transportation costs.

---

#### 2. **Quantity Match Score** (20 points)
Evaluates how well the resource quantity matches the request.

| Match Quality | Score | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| 80-120% of requested | 20 points | 100% (Perfect) |
| 50-150% of requested | 14 points | 70% (Good) |
| Other | 8 points | 40% (Acceptable) |

**Why it matters:** Prevents waste and ensures efficient resource allocation.

**Example:**
- Request: 50 units
- Resource: 55 units ‚Üí 110% match ‚Üí 20 points ‚úÖ
- Resource: 100 units ‚Üí 200% match ‚Üí 8 points (too much excess)

---

#### 3. **Donor Rating Score** (20 points)
Prioritizes resources from highly-rated, reliable donors.

**Calculation:**
```
Base Score = (Donor Rating / 5) √ó 20
```

**Bonuses:**
- 10+ ratings: +20% bonus (more reliable)
- 5-9 ratings: +10% bonus
- <5 ratings: No bonus

**Example:**
- Donor with 4.5‚≠ê rating and 12 reviews:
  - Base: (4.5/5) √ó 20 = 18 points
  - Bonus: 18 √ó 1.2 = 21.6 points
  - Final: 20 points (capped at max)

**Why it matters:** Ensures quality and reliability of resources.

---

#### 4. **Freshness Score** (10 points)
Newer resources get priority (important for perishables).

| Resource Age | Score | Percentage |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| ‚â§1 day | 10 points | 100% |
| 1-3 days | 8 points | 80% |
| 3-7 days | 6 points | 60% |
| 7-14 days | 4 points | 40% |
| >14 days | 2 points | 20% |

**Why it matters:** Ensures resources are still usable, especially for food/medicine.

---

#### 5. **Urgency Bonus** (10 points)
High-priority requests get bonus for nearby resources.

| Urgency | Condition | Bonus |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| High | Distance ‚â§10 km | +10 points |
| Medium | Distance ‚â§20 km | +5 points |
| Low | - | 0 points |

**Why it matters:** Prioritizes critical, time-sensitive needs.

---

### **Resource Matching Example**

**Request:**
- Type: Food
- Quantity: 50 units
- Urgency: High
- Location: [76.70, 10.80]

**Available Resources:**

| Resource | Distance | Quantity | Donor Rating | Age | Proximity | Quantity | Rating | Freshness | Urgency | **Total** |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------|-----|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| A | 3 km | 55 units | 4.5‚≠ê (15 reviews) | 1 day | 40 | 20 | 20 | 10 | 10 | **100** ‚úÖ |
| B | 8 km | 50 units | 4.0‚≠ê (5 reviews) | 2 days | 30 | 20 | 17.6 | 8 | 10 | **85.6** |
| C | 15 km | 100 units | 5.0‚≠ê (20 reviews) | 5 days | 20 | 8 | 20 | 6 | 0 | **54** |

**Winner: Resource A** (Perfect match!)

---

## üöÄ Volunteer Matching Algorithm

### **Scoring Criteria (Total: 100 points)**

#### 1. **Proximity to Donor** (40 points)
Distance from volunteer to pickup location.

| Distance | Score |
|----------|-------|
| 0-5 km | 40 points |
| 5-10 km | 30 points |
| 10-20 km | 20 points |
| 20-50 km | 10 points |
| >50 km | 4 points |

---

#### 2. **Proximity to Requester** (20 points)
Distance from volunteer to delivery location.

| Distance | Score |
|----------|-------|
| 0-10 km | 20 points |
| 10-20 km | 14 points |
| 20-50 km | 8 points |
| >50 km | 2 points |

---

#### 3. **Volunteer Rating** (25 points)
Based on past performance.

**Calculation:**
```
Base Score = (Rating / 5) √ó 25
```

**Bonuses:**
- 10+ ratings: +20% bonus
- 5-9 ratings: +10% bonus

---

#### 4. **Workload Score** (15 points)
Fewer active tasks = higher availability.

| Active Tasks | Score |
|--------------|-------|
| 0 tasks | 15 points |
| 1 task | 10.5 points |
| 2 tasks | 6 points |
| 3+ tasks | 3 points |

---

#### 5. **Urgency Bonus** (10 points)
For high-priority requests with nearby volunteers.

| Condition | Bonus |
|-----------|-------|
| High urgency + Distance ‚â§5 km | +10 points |

---

### **Volunteer Matching Example**

**Delivery:**
- Pickup (Donor): [76.65, 10.78]
- Delivery (Requester): [76.70, 10.80]
- Urgency: High

**Available Volunteers:**

| Volunteer | Dist to Donor | Dist to Req | Rating | Active Tasks | Donor Prox | Req Prox | Rating | Workload | Urgency | **Total** |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------------|------------|----------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Mike | 2 km | 3 km | 4.8‚≠ê (12) | 0 | 40 | 20 | 25 | 15 | 10 | **110** ‚úÖ |
| Sarah | 6 km | 8 km | 4.5‚≠ê (8) | 1 | 30 | 20 | 24.75 | 10.5 | 0 | **85.25** |
| John | 12 km | 15 km | 5.0‚≠ê (20) | 2 | 20 | 14 | 25 | 6 | 0 | **65** |

**Winner: Mike** (Closest, available, highly rated!)
