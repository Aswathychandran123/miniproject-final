# 🗺️ Map Location Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Map was showing New York, USA instead of India (Kerala region)

**Solution:** Updated map center coordinates from `[40.7128, -74.006]` (New York) to `[10.8505, 76.2711]` (Kerala, India)

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before:
```javascript
<MapContainer center={[40.7128, -74.006]} zoom={12}>
```
- Centered on: New York City, USA
- Zoom: 12 (city level)

### After:
```javascript
<MapContainer center={[10.8505, 76.2711]} zoom={10}>
```
- Centered on: Kerala, India
- Zoom: 10 (region level)
- Height: 100% (full container)

## 📍 Coordinates Explained

**Kerala, India:**
- Latitude: 10.8505° N
- Longitude: 76.2711° E
- Region: Central Kerala (near Thrissur/Palakkad)

This matches your test data locations:
- `76.65, 10.78` (Palakkad area)
- `76.70, 10.80` (nearby locations)

## 🚀 Just Restart Frontend
