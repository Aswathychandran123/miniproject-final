## 📋 How to Create and See Tasks

### Step 1: Create Test Users

You need 3 types of users:

   - Email: donor@test.com
   - Password: password123

   - Location: `76.65,10.78` (longitude,latitude)

3. **Wait for Admin Approval:**
   - Login as admin
   - Go to Users tab
   - Approve the donor

4. **Login as Donor** and add a resource:
   - Type: Food
   - Quantity: 50
   - Description: Rice bags

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No tasks showing up"

**Check these:**

1. **Volunteer Availability**
   - Make sure button shows "✓ Available" (green)
   - If red, click to toggle

2. **Admin Approval**
   - All users must be approved by admin
   - Check Users tab in admin dashboard

3. **Resource Exists**
   - Donor must have added a resource
   - Resource status should be "available"

4. **Location Data**
   - Volunteer must have location in profile
   - Use format: `longitude,latitude` (e.g., `76.65,10.78`)

5. **Backend Running**
   - Make sure backend is running on port 5001
   - Check console for errors

6. **Socket.IO Connection**
   - Check browser console for Socket.IO connection
   - Should see: "Socket connected"

### "Task assigned but not showing"

**Try these:**

1. **Refresh the page** (F5)
2. **Check browser console** for errors
3. **Check backend console** for matching logs
4. **Verify API call:**
   - Open DevTools → Network tab
   - Look for `/delivery-tasks` request
   - Check response data

### "Can't see matching scores"

- Make sure you're logged in as **requester**
- Scores only show after submitting a request
- Look for green card below the form

2. **Use realistic locations** - Coordinates should be valid (India: ~70-90 lng, 8-35 lat)
3. **Test urgency levels** - Try high/medium/low to see priority
4. **Test multiple volunteers** - Create 2-3 volunteers to see nearest selection
5. **Check admin matching analytics** - See match rates and quality metrics

## 🚀 Next Steps

After seeing tasks work:

1. Test the complete workflow (accept → start → complete)
2. Test rating system (requester rates volunteer)
3. Test dispute reporting (report an issue)
4. Check admin analytics (matching tab)
5. Test with multiple simultaneous requests
