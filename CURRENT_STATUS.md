## 🎯 Current Configuration

### **Defaults Set for Backward Compatibility:**

**New users automatically get:**
- `isApproved: true` (approved by default)
- `isActive: true` (active by default)
- `verificationStatus: 'verified'` (verified by default)

**This means:**
- ✅ Existing users will work without issues
- ✅ New users can login immediately
- ✅ Admin can still manually manage users if needed

**If you want manual approval:**
Change in `User.js`:
```javascript
isApproved: { type: Boolean, default: false },
verificationStatus: { type: String, default: 'pending' },
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use Your System

### **Option 1: Use as Decentralized (Current Setup)**
- All users auto-approved
- No admin intervention needed
- Admin dashboard available for monitoring only

### **Option 2: Use as Hybrid with Admin Control**
1. Change defaults in User.js to require approval
2. Admin must approve each new user
3. Full centralized control

## 🔧 Customization Options

### **Want Manual User Approval?**

Edit `models/User.js`:
```javascript
isApproved: { type: Boolean, default: false },
verificationStatus: { type: String, default: 'pending' },
```

Then new users must wait for admin approval.

### **Want to Remove Admin Features?**

Simply don't use the admin dashboard. The system works fine without it.

### **Want to Add More Admin Features?**

Edit `AdminDashboard.jsx` and add new tabs or functionality.
