3. **Server.js Updated** - Added CORS and all route registrations
4. **Backend Routes** - All admin routes now properly registered

---

## 🚀 Steps to Start the Application

### **Step 1: Start Backend Server**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use Command Prompt (cmd), NOT PowerShell**

Open **Command Prompt** and run:

```cmd
cd "d:\Decentralized disaster resource sharing app\disaster-resource-backend"
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 5001
MongoDB Connected
```

**If you see this, backend is running! ✅**

---

### **Step 2: Start Frontend** (New Terminal)

Open a **NEW Command Prompt** window:

```cmd
cd "d:\Decentralized disaster resource sharing app\disaster-resource-frontend"
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Compiled successfully!
Local: http://localhost:3000
```

**Browser will automatically open to http://localhost:3000**

---

### **Step 3: Login**

1. You'll see the login page
2. Enter credentials:
   - **Email:** `admin@test.com`
   - **Password:** `admin123`
3. Click **Login**
4. You should now see the Admin Dashboard! 🎉

## 🐛 If Login Still Fails

### **Check 1: Is Backend Running?**

Open browser and go to: `http://localhost:5001`

- If you see a page (even an error), backend is running ✅
- If "Can't reach this page", backend is NOT running ❌

**Solution:** Start backend using Command Prompt (not PowerShell)

---

### **Check 2: Check Browser Console**

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Try to login
4. Look for errors

**Common Errors:**

**Error: "Failed to fetch" or "Network Error"**
- Backend is not running
- Start backend server

**Error: "CORS policy"**
- Backend CORS not configured (already fixed in server.js)
- Restart backend server

**Error: "Invalid credentials"**
- Wrong email/password
- Use: `admin@test.com` / `admin123`

---

### **Check 3: Verify Admin User**

Run this in Command Prompt:

```cmd
cd "d:\Decentralized disaster resource sharing app\disaster-resource-backend"
node testLogin.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Admin user found
✅ Password verification: SUCCESS
```

If you see errors, run:
```cmd
node updateAdmin.js
```

---

### **Check 4: Check Backend Logs**

Look at the terminal where backend is running.

When you try to login, you should see:
```
POST /auth/login
```

If you don't see this, the request isn't reaching the backend.

## 🔍 Detailed Troubleshooting

### **Issue: PowerShell Script Execution Error**

**Error Message:**
```
npm : File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because 
running scripts is disabled on this system.
```

**Solution:**
Use **Command Prompt (cmd)** instead of PowerShell

**How to open Command Prompt:**
1. Press `Win + R`
2. Type `cmd`
3. Press Enter

---

### **Issue: Port Already in Use**

**Error Message:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5001
```

**Solution 1: Kill the process**
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :5001
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
```

**Solution 2: Change port**
Edit `.env` file:
```
PORT=5002
```

Then update frontend API URL in `AdminDashboard.jsx`:
```javascript
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5002';
```

---

### **Issue: MongoDB Connection Failed**

**Error Message:**
```
MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED
```

**Solution:**
Check your `.env` file has correct MongoDB URI:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/disasterDB
```

---

### **Issue: Frontend Can't Connect to Backend**

**Symptoms:**
- Login button does nothing
- Console shows "Failed to fetch"

**Solution:**
1. Ensure backend is running on port 5001
2. Check CORS is enabled in server.js (already fixed)
3. Restart both servers

## 🎯 Quick Test

### **Test Backend Directly**

Use this PowerShell command to test login API:

```powershell
$body = @{
    email = "admin@test.com"
    password = "admin123"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5001/auth/login" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Admin User",
    "email": "admin@test.com",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

If you get this response, backend is working! ✅
