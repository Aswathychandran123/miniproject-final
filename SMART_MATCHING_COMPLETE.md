## 🎯 How It Works

### Stage 1: Resource Matching

When a request is submitted, the algorithm:

1. **Finds available resources** matching the requested type and quantity
2. **Scores each resource** based on:
   - **Proximity (40 pts):** Distance from requester
   - **Quantity Match (20 pts):** How well quantity matches request
   - **Donor Rating (20 pts):** Reliability and quality
   - **Freshness (10 pts):** Age of resource
   - **Urgency Bonus (10 pts):** Extra points for critical needs
3. **Selects best match** with highest score

### Stage 2: Volunteer Matching

With the selected resource, the algorithm:

1. **Finds available volunteers** (approved, active, available)
2. **Scores each volunteer** based on:
   - **Proximity to Donor (40 pts):** Distance to pickup location
   - **Proximity to Requester (20 pts):** Distance to delivery location
   - **Volunteer Rating (25 pts):** Past performance
   - **Workload (15 pts):** Current active tasks
   - **Urgency Bonus (10 pts):** Extra points for urgent deliveries
3. **Assigns best volunteer** with highest score

### Stage 3: Task Creation

1. **Creates delivery task** linking volunteer, resource, and request
2. **Updates statuses** (resource → requested, request → assigned)
3. **Sends real-time notification** to volunteer via Socket.IO
4. **Returns match quality** and scoring breakdown

## 📊 Scoring Examples

### Perfect Match (95-100 points)
- Resource 3 km away (40 pts proximity)
- Quantity 55 for request of 50 (20 pts quantity)
- Donor rated 4.8⭐ with 15 reviews (20 pts rating)
- Added today (10 pts freshness)
- High urgency + close (10 pts bonus)
- **Total: 100/100** ✅

### Good Match (70-90 points)
- Resource 12 km away (20 pts proximity)
- Quantity 50 for request of 50 (20 pts quantity)
- Donor rated 3.5⭐ with 8 reviews (15 pts rating)
- Added 2 days ago (8 pts freshness)
- Medium urgency (5 pts bonus)
- **Total: 68/100** ✅

### Acceptable Match (50-70 points)
- Resource 35 km away (10 pts proximity)
- Quantity 200 for request of 50 (8 pts quantity)
- New donor, no rating (0 pts rating)
- Added 10 days ago (4 pts freshness)
- Low urgency (0 pts bonus)
- **Total: 22/100** ⚠️

## 🚀 Running the Demo

### Option 1: Automated (Easiest)

```bash
cd disaster-resource-backend
runSmartMatchingDemo.bat
```

This runs all three scripts automatically with pauses between each step.

### Option 2: Manual (Step-by-step)

```bash
cd disaster-resource-backend

# Step 1: Setup test data
node setupSmartMatchingTest.js

# Step 2: Run matching tests
node testSmartMatching.js

# Step 3: Verify analytics
node verifyMatchingAnalytics.js
```

### Option 3: Web Interface

1. Run setup script to create test users
2. Start backend: `npm run dev`
3. Start frontend: `cd ../disaster-resource-frontend && npm start`
4. Login as requester: `relief@smarttest.com / test123`
5. Submit a request and watch the console logs
